# Desktop program sample
This repo contains very simple code tying together several of my libraries
to provide a cross-platform boilerplate for graphical software development.

The entire stack is licensed under WTFPL and consists in:
 - [Globox](https://github.com/nullgemm/globox) for windowing
 - [Willis](https://github.com/nullgemm/willis) for mouse/keyboard input
 - [Cursoryx](https://github.com/nullgemm/cursoryx) for mouse cursor management
 - [Dpishit](https://github.com/nullgemm/dpishit) for screen density detection

Each of this components is modular and should be usable independently.
Globox, the most complex one, would not have been possible without my teachers
at the [IMAC](https://ingenieur-imac.fr/) school of engineering, who allowed
me to build it as part of a school project during my final year.
